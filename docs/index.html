<h1>Phage Dwelling Temperatures - Black Rock City 2019</h1>

<p>Comparison of dwelling temperatures at The Phage, 4:00 &amp; Esp, Burning Man 2019
</p>

<p>
An examination of thermodynamics in a variety of playa dwellings:
<ul>
    <li>baseline outdoor recording (Taken from Altitude Lounge @ 845&C)</li>
    <li>shiftpod 1 (A/C, no shade)</li>
    <li>shiftpod 2 - mjp (light use of swamp cooler, shade structure)</li>
    <li>shiftpod 2 - pnelson (heavy use of swamp cooler, shade structure, blastshield)</li>
    <li>H12 hexayurt (no cooling)</li>
</ul>

        Temperatures fluctuated a fair amount over the course of the week but were fairly mild overall.
        The measured outside high temperature was 96.1&deg;F, and the low was 54.1&deg;F.

        As Marty has known for ages, it is better to just sleep outside.
        On average, the hexayurt stays warmer at night. If we had a recording of
        a yurt with a swamp cooler or an A/C, this would easily be the most comfortable
        dwelling.</p>
    <p>
        The Shiftpod2 in the shade with "aggressive" use of a swamp cooler stayed
        much cooler during the heat of the day than the other Shiftpod2 (also in the shade).
        The Shiftpod1 in the sun was using an A/C, which also strongly decreased the
        slowly rising morning temperature.
